**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
Suppose $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ is a random sample from $U(0, \theta)$.
1. Show:
$$
\mathbb{E}[X_{(n)}] = \frac{n}{n+1} \theta, \quad \mathrm{Var}(X_{(n)}) = \frac{n\theta^2}{(n+1)^2(n+2)}
$$

2. Find multiples of $X_n$ and $X_{(n)}$ which are unbiased for $\theta$ and compute their MSE.
