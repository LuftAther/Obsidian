**Exponential Rate Estimator**

Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from $\text{Exp}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda > 0$ is unknown.
1. Find the method of moments estimator of $\lambda$.
2. Find the MLE of $\lambda$.
3. Determine the asymptotic distribution of the MLE.
4. The MLE of $\lambda$ is biased. Derive an unbiased estimator for $\lambda$ by “correcting” the MLE.
