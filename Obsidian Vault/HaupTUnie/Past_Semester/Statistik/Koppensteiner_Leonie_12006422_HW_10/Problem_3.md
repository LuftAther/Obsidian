### Geometric exponential family

Consider independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$ and let $X$ be the number of failures before the first success. Then
$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x) = p(1 - p)^x, \quad x = 0, 1, \ldots,
$$
and $X$ has the geometric distribution with parameter $p$.

1. Show the distributions form an exponential family.

2. Write the pmfs for the family in canonical form, identifying the natural parameter $\phi$ and $b(\phi)$.

3. Find the mean of the geometric *using a differential identity*.

4. Suppose $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are iid from a geometric distribution with parameter $p$. Show that the joint forms an exponential family and find the mean and variance of the natural statistic $T(X_1, \ldots, X_n)$.
